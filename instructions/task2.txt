CS207 SEMESTER 2 PROJECT

Instructions for Task 2
---

The details of Task 2 are on the course webpage.  These instructions
are only to explain how to set up the project working copy and Eclipse
for the minimum of problems, and how to submit the task once you have
completed it.

NOTE: both partners have to do these instructions in a specific order
otherwise Eclipse will be unhappy.  It is suggested that you use
Eclipse and the UML lab plug-in for this.  The Lab computers have
licenses for UML Lab;  if you want to use it at home, then a demo
license is available.

Getting Started
---

I assume you are in the working directory of your project, i.e. the
one where the readme file is.
